# ANN_transcritical_COP_prdiction
Using Machine Learning an Artificial Neural network was created which predicts COP of a trancritical cycle.
The dataset was generated using Engineering Equation solver EES by writing a program.
The EES program and dataset has been upladed in the repository.
Using KERAS sublibrary of Tenserflow an Artifical neural network of sequential class was created with 6 input nodes 6 hidden layer nodes and 1 ouput layer node.
The predictions were quite accurate and R2 score was more than 80%.
